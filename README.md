# New_Crest_Wave_Height_Model
Statistical models for the distributions for Hmax and Emax corresponding to one-hour periods of observation, 
across a variety of different sea states.

The MATLAB sjrndn.m Function was developped within the AWARE Project coordinated and financed by TOTAL, DK. 


 This function generates random 1 hour max realizations from the Schubert-Jonathan (SJ) distribution function
 for wave and crest heigths based on the results of the Total DK AWARE project.

 The model assumes that the 1h-max wave & crest heights result from a generalized
 extreme value distribution with a negative shape parameter, so that the
 upper end point exists.

 Details of the modelling approach and the data used can be found in the paper:
 On the distribution of maximum wave and crest height at intermediate water depths, submitted to Journal of ocean engineering, 19.12.2019
