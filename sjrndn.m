% This function generates random 1 hour max normalized wave heights from the Schubert-Jonathan (SJ) distribution function
% for wave and crest heigths based on the results of the AWARE project and the basin tests by DHI.
%
% The model assumes that the 1h-max wave heights result from a generalized
% extreme value distribution with a negative shape parameter, so that the
% upper end point exists. The output is not sorted.

% Theoretical details of the model can be found in:
% Schubert M., et. al (2020), On the distribution of maximum crest and wave height at intermediate water depths, Journal of Ocean Engineering

%
%   Sea-state parameters for normalized analysis:
%   
%   d0~depth (model developed for d=45m) (DEFAULT=45m) -  scalar value
%   Years - Vector of number of years considered & more than 1 event (storm) per year.

%   norm: 'real' --> gives results in the real space; unit: [m]
%           Para 1: Hs ~ Significant wave height defined as four times the standard deviation of the surface elevation in [m] (e.g. Hs=14.5)  
%           Para 2: Tp ~ Spectral peak period  in [s] (e.g. Tp=12)
%           Para 3: Sp ~ directional spreading in degree (e.g. if Sp_deg=20 then
%           Sp_dir==180*2^0.5/(pi*(20+1)^0.5)=17.68

%         'norm' --> gives results in the normalized space (normalized by Hm0); unit: [-]
%           Para 1: U ~ Ursell number (e.g. U=0.25) --- Vector same size as years (lifetimes)
%           Para 2: Stp ~ Steepness (e.g. Stp=0.0356) --- Vector same size as years (lifetimes)
%           Para 3: Sp ~ directional spreading in degree (e.g. if Sp_deg=20 then
%           Sp_dir==180*2^0.5/(pi*(20+1)^0.5)=17.68.

%   Char:  'wave' --> random numbers of wave height
%          'crest' --> random numbers of crest height

%	Type: 'Hm0MEAN'--> E[Hm0]:= the variability of Hm0 is considered in the response surface. The surface considers the variability of Hm0 in the DHI tank.
%								It is a mixture of natural variability in Hm0 coming from the spectrum used for generating the waves 
%								and possible and unquantified variability of the measurements and caused by the tank experience. 
%								These are inherent uncertainties which might not occur in reality.
%
%		  'Hm0VAR'--> Hm0:= the variability of the hourly Hm0 is not considered in the response surface, i.e. the response if fitted to the data normalized by an hourly Hm0.
%                   			For real applications it is recommended to use this option. The natural variability of Hm0 in hour is determined by the spectrum. 
%								For the JONSWAP spectrum a normal distribution with a coefficient of variation is in the range of 0.03-0.04 can be assumed. 
%								For other spectra the hourly variability might be different. The result in this case can be multiplied with (randn(Nlftms,NSmpls).*0.04+1):
%								height_new=bsxfun(@times,height,(randn(Nlftms,NSmpls).*0.04+1));
%								The natural variability due to the spectrum of Hm0 will be higher for 0.5h max and converge to zero in case of a 100h maximum.

%
%   Nlftms - Number of Lifetimes (epistemic uncertainty) optional, default=1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   OUTPUT:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   
%   HEIGHT 
%   All result are "Number of lifetimes (NmSm_Lftm)*realizations per lifetime (NmSm_smpls)" realizations of the normalized crest/wave
%   height.
%   In each column a number of realizations of the 1h max crest/wave height is generated. The number of realizations are the realizations within one lifetime. 
%   In each row "one lifetime" is simulated using one realization of
%   beta values. The number of columns represent the number of hours in one
%   lifetime. In each row a new set of beta is used and a "new lifetime" is
%   simulated.

%   PARAGEV
%   The output is a Number of lifetimes*3 matrix of realizations of the GEV
%   parameters. This might be of use in the case the distributions is
%   needed in an analysis.

%   UEP
%   The realization of the upper end point of the distribution is provided.
%   The variability of this value might be quite large and this value gets
%   numerically instable in the case the scale parameter is close to zero.
%   The mean value of the realizations might be stable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% IMPORTANT REMARKS:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The model is constructed using mean value estimates for Steepness and Ursell-Number and Tp.
% In case Type 2 is chosen, the hourly variability of Hm0 conditional on the sea state parameters need to be considered outside this function.
% In Type 1 included the hourly variability of Hm0 in response surface.

% No MATLAB Toolboxes needed to be called for using this function.
% This code used a Cholesky decomposition for generating multivariate
% random numbers.
